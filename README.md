# VPC
## AIM:
To study the steps involved in setting up a private cloud using AWS or Microsoft Azure platforms and explore its core features and services.
## PROCEDURE :
~~~
1.Create a Cloud Account: -Sign up for an account on AWS or Microsoft Azure.
*Complete verification using email and credit card information.
2.Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
*In AWS: Use the VPC Dashboard to create a new VPC.
*In Azure: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) from the Azure Portal.
3.Configure Subnets and Routing:
*Define public and private subnets.
*Set up route tables to control traffic flow.
4.Create and Launch Instances:
*Launch EC2 (AWS) or Virtual Machine (Azure) instances inside the VPC or VNet.
*Assign instances to appropriate subnets.
5.Security Configuration:
*Create and assign security groups or Network Security Groups (NSGs).
*Set up inbound/outbound rules for communication.
6.Storage and Networking:
*Attach storage (EBS/Azure Disks).
*Configure load balancers and gateways if needed.
7.Testing:
*Verify connectivity between instances.
*Test access.
